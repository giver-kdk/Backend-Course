/*
	Prototype: 
	It is about pre-concept of data manipulation features generally like:
	methods and properties with array and objects
	i.e; one property of array: length (ex: arr.length)
	one method of array: push(ex: arr.push(args...))

*/

// To check built-in prototypes of array and object, we can do: 
// See i nbrowser for detailed prototypes like: forEach, map, indexOf, ...etc
console.log(Array());
console.log(Object());

// We can create our own prototype as well
